## Current "Standard" Implementation: 
Obyte, IOTA, Nano, Avalanche

## The Idea(l):
With PBFT mechanisms, once the network decides on something, it is final. There is no forking, very strong confidence once something is committed then it will never change. In Nakamoto Consensus or Logos's the probabalistic consensus mechanism starts from low confidence and probabilistic/confidence grows over time (usually builds exponentially) with no real 'set' finality (can implement a threshold of confidence).
