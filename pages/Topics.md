Prep (*Difficulty*) is defined as the ease of which the Topic can be generally understood. (Future: Make into more fun visual or something more enjoyable than a difficulty bar.)

Cook Time (*Scope*) is in reference to a qualitative assessment of the breadth and depth of information necessary to learn to gain a decent level of comprehension of a Topic.

Ingredients (*Resources*) is for links relevant to helping people understand the concepts. Number references and use superscript notation to reference mentions in terminology Recipes descriptions.
