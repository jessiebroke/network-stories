## **Operating Definitions:**

Prep (*Difficulty*) is defined as the ease of which the concepts can be generally understood. (Future: Make into more fun visual or something more enjoyable than a difficulty bar.)

Cook Time (*Scope*) is in reference to the size of information necessary to learn to gain a decent level of comprehension.

Ingredients (*Resources*) is for links relevant to helping people understand the concepts. Number references and use superscript notation to reference mentions in terminology Recipes descriptions.

	Future Work: Adjust difficulty/time ratings, cook time respec. based on feedback from everyone at DXB.
